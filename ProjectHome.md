This project maintains a special build of the open source Delta3D game engine which is tailored for integration into a VR Juggler cluster application. Deltajug modifies the Delta3D engine's entire run loop to be exposed for integration with a VR Juggler render loop. The current release v0.1 is built on-top of Delta3D-2.4.0 as is currently compiling on RHEL5. There is currently no support for other operating systems, but may still be fully compatible.

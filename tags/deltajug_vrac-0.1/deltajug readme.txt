# DeltaJug: A VR Juggler friendly game engine #
###############################################

Welcome to DeltaJug! We hope you can get up and running with DeltaJug
as soon as possible. DeltaJug is a modification of the Delta3D game
engine to allow integration into VR Juggler for running applications
in a clustered environment on a large, tiled display system. DeltaJug
is built exactly like Delta3D, so for details on how to build DeltaJug,
refer to the readme.txt file.
